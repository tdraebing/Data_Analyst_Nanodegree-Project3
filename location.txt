I am from Germany, so I wanted to wrangle a map of a German city. Although I never lived in Hamburg (so far), I love the city for it's harbor, nightlife and the attitude of the people living there. Thus I would like to get to know the city a little better. I also chose it, because I think German street names are more challenging than American ones, since in generel there are more irregular names.
