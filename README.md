# Project-3: Data Wrangle OpenStreetMaps Data

The wrangling_hamburg.py file can be used to start the complete wrangling process and to start the queries used in the report. The single functions are distributed over the other python files. The raw data folder contains the sample data file.

Project description by Udacity:

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about.
